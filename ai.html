             <p>Artificial Intelligence! You already know that I had to mention it in a blog. AI is the future of technology. If you have been living under a rock for the past couple 
                of decades I'll explain what Artificial Intelligence is. From oracle: "In simple terms, AI is technology(like systems or machines) that mimic human intelligence."</p>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence helps machines have the capability to adapt, reason, and provide solutions. AI also brings another topic related to it, machine learning. Machine learning is an application of AI. Ml is the process of using math and data to help the machine or computer learn without any direct code. This is a key component in AI because this is what allows the machine to learn with experience and without direct code.</p>
                <p>At the moment I do not have any plans in creating something with AI. I wrote about it because I want to share this interesting topic with you guys and encourage everyone to try to learn how to build something with AI if you have a strong interest in this area.</p>

                    <p>.NET MAUI is the newest technology I started taking interest in. For those of you who don't know, (and don't feel bad because I didn't) .NET MAUI is a "Multi-platform App UI cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML". This is so interesting because you can run apps on different devices from a single shared code-base.</p>
                    <p>.NET MAUI is also the integration of Xamarin Forms into .NET 6. Xamarin Forms is like .NET MAUI, just for the older versions of the .NET framework. MAUI is also part of an open-source community with over 3,700 companies. With the support of the community, people can make applications with ease.</p>
                    <p>As of right now, this is all I know about .NET MAUI, but I will contiue to do my research and look up a tutorial on how to set up my programming environment. Once I get the basics down, I will attempt to create some sort of app with the Framework.</p>

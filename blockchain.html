                <p>So you want to learn about block chain technology? Well you have entered the right place! My interest in blockchain technology started when I learned about cryptocurrency. 
                Did you know that Bitcoin was the reason for which blockchain technology was invented? Neither did I till I searched it up! On a serious note, Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change.</p>
                <p>Blockchain technology has three components, Data, Hash, and Hash of previous block. Depending on the blockchain, data can have different things. For example, data that can be stored is a transaction, and the information of the people involved in the transaction. A hash is a unique identifier that identifies all of its contents. This can be compared to ones DNA or fingerprints since those are unique to oneself.</p>
                <p>The last component of blockchain is the hash of a previous block. This is where the name comes from. Each block chains together with the other, making it so secure. This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to blockchain. I will continue to do my research and see if I can update you guys with more information!</p>

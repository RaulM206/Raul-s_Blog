                     <p>This blog is about my interest in the React Framework. My interest to this Framework started when I was learning simple javascript on my own time. While I was 
                        watching a video on javascript, I saw a video on the recommended page about the React Framework. For those who are unaware of the React Framework, it is a free and open source

                     <p>So you want to learn about block chain technology? Well you have entered the right place! My interest in blockchain technology started when I learned about cryptocurrency. 
                        Did you know that Bitcoin was the reason for which blockchain technology was invented? Neither did I till I searched it up! On a serious note, Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that....

                         Artificial Intelligence! You already know that I had to mention it in a blog. AI is the future of technology. If you have been living under a rock for the past couple 
                         of decades i'll explain what Artificial Intelligence is. From oracle: "In simple terms, AI is technology(like systems or machines) that mimic human intelligence..."

                         .NET MAUI is the newest technology I started taking interest in. For those of you who don't know, (and don't feel bad because I didn't) .NET MAUI is a "Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML". This is so interesting because you can run apps on different devices from a single shared code-base. That's insane!

                    One of the first classes in the CS program I took was the bits and bytes of cloud computing. This class was more I.T. based but it still helped me learn about Amazon web services. These services would not be here if it weren't for cloud computing. In the simple terms, cloud computing are computer services like software and servers that are over the cloud. The cloud represents the Internet in this case. Software and servers are not the only things that are available via cloud computing. There is also....

                    For those who have always been interested in technology, virtual reality is a topic we have all looked into. Virtual Reality is like a simulation that can be similar or different from the real world. At first I just thought that virtual reality was for games, but I was so wrong! VR can be used for entertainment, education and much more. For games, there are many developer tools that people use. For example, people use...

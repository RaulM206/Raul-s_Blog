                <p>The video I on the left explains what is react, how to use its basics, and the purpose of the framework. It is a really good video made by Fireship and you should check their channel out.</p>
                <p>This blog is about my interest in the React Framework. My interest to this Framework started when I was learning simple javascript on my own time. While I was watching a video on javascript, I saw a video on the recommended page about the React Framework. For those who are unaware of the React Framework, it is a free and open source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by meta and a bunch of people who use it. For example if you need to develop something in the React Framework, it probably has some sort of support library already to help you develop what you want.</p>
                <p>I was thinking of what projects I can do with the React Framework. One idea I had was to create a Real-Time chat app. With help of some chat API, I might be able to do it. What do you guys think?</p>

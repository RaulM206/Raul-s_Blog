                    <p> For those who have always been interested in technology, virtual reality is a topic we have all looked into. Virtual Reality is like a simulation that can be similar or different from the real world. At first I just thought that virtual reality was for games, but I was so wrong! VR can be used for entertainment, education and much more. For games, there are many developer tools that people use. For example, people use Unity or the Unreal Engine.</p>
                    <p>If you want to use the Unreal Engine, you should learn C++. If you use Unity, the programming language you will use is C#.</p>
                    <p>The reason I wanted to talk about Virtual Reality is because it gives you another way to interact with a computer. In Virtual Reality, you can interact with the computer as we do in the real world. If you would like to know more about Virtual Reality you should talk to William Cram! I am pretty sure he is an expert things related to VR(or at least he'll know more than me!).</p>
                    <p>Regarding project with virtual reality, I do not plan any projects with it, but it would be cool to learn how to create a game for a virtual reality headset.</p>

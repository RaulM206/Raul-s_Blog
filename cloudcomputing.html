                    <p> One of the first classes in the CS program I took was the bits and bytes of cloud computing. This class was more I.T. based but it still helped me learn about Amazon web services. These services would not be here if it weren't for cloud computing. In the simple terms, cloud computing are computer services like software and servers that are over the cloud. The cloud represents the Internet in this case. Software and servers are not the only things that are available via cloud computing. There is also databases, networking, and also analytics.</p>
                    <p>There are many benefits with cloud computing. For example, Cost. You only pay for whay you need. Scalability, you can scale the servers for what you need, this will help with cost because you only pay for what you need. Speed, with the latest technology and the vast amount of resources can be provisioned in minutes. This can give a business a lot of flexiblity and preformance a lot faster.</p>
                    <p>There are many more benefits with cloud computing, but these are only a few that I have mentioned. Hopefully in the future I can use these tools in software engineering jobs.</p>
